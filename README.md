Exited to share my project : IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION 
Developed a ML Model for classifying iris
flowers based on their features using
Python, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow.

ABOUT DATASET

It includes three iris species with 50 samples each as well as some properties about each flower. One flower species is linearly separable from the other two, but the other two are not linearly separable from each other.
The columns in this dataset are:
Id
SepalLengthCm
SepalWidthCm
PetalLengthCm
PetalWidthCm
Species

It also includes:
1.Relation between species and sepal length
2.Relationship between species and sepal width
3.Relationship between sepal width and sepal length
4.Pairplot
5.Boxplot
6.Andrew_curves
7.CategoricaPlot
8.ViolinPlot
